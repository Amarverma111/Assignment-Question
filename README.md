# Assignment-Question
Solve a Synchronization Problem

For this part of the assignment, you are expected to implements a solution to a synchronization problem called the "cats and mice" problem.The synchronization primitivies that you may use in your solution are semaphores,locks,and conditions variables.you are free to use whichever of these sysnchronization primitives you choose,however you like.However,you must not directly use any 
"lower-level" methods of synchronization,such as wait channels or spinlocks.
