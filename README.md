# Assignment-Question
Solve a Synchronization Problem For this part of the assignment, you are expected to implement a solution to a synchronization problem called the “cats and mice” problem. The synchronization primitives that you may use in your solution are semaphores, locks, and condition variables. You are free to use whichever of these synchronization primitives you choose, however you like. However, you must not directly use any “lower-level” methods of synchronization, such as wait channels or spinlocks.
